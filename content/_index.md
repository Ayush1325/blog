Hello everyone, I am Ayush Singh, a University Student from India. This website is mainly a blog where I write about projects I am working on or things I find interesting.

I mostly do System Programming and am experienced with C, C++, Rust, Python and Clojure. I am also quite experienced with Rust Programming langage internals and am actively working on Rust Standard Library implementation for UEFI targets.

I am open for Internships/Part-time as a Software Developer. Feel free to check-out my work on this website.
