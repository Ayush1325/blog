Hello Everyone, I am Ayush Singh, a University Student pursuing Integrated Master of Technology in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad.

This website is mainly a blog where I write about projects I am working on or things I find interesting.

I am most proficient in Systems Programming and experienced in languages such as C, C++ and Rust. I frequently work on Open Source Projects in my free time. My primary Operating System is Linux and my desktop environment of choice is KDE.
